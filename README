I created a dynamic Drum Kit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my frontend development journey. This interactive web application features a set of virtual drums that respond to both keyboard presses and mouse clicks. Each drum element produces a unique sound when triggered, providing an immersive and engaging user experience. Through this project, I honed my skills in event handling, DOM manipulation, and styling with CSS. It showcases the power of front-end technologies in creating interactive and enjoyable web applications, marking a significant step in my journey to becoming a proficient web developer.
